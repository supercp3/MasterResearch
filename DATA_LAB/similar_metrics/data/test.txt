1|the sims 2 mac the sims was one of the most popular games ever made. in it players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people or sims and influence their paths toward success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. its open ended blend of cartoonish behavior and everyday living is unique in an art form otherwise obsessed with carnage and sports. with the sims 2 longtime fans now have a deeper game with lots of ways to customize and share their experiences. the game will also attract first timers because the goal oriented gameplay and the luridly fun starter families make it easier to get into the action right out of the box. now sims are born with the traits of their parents families grow and sims grow old. the people in your neighborhood the game starts at the neighborhood level. here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three premade neighborhoods each with its own theme. from there you ll settle on a house and a family of sims to control. create your own sim above or your own house below from scratch with advanced tools. aside from the basic needs carried over from the previous game sims now have aspirations wants and fears. the wants and fears are the day to day things that occupy their minds like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss. satisfy their wants and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them. realize their fears and sims become lethargic cranky and unresponsive to your commands. aspirations are the big picture things like raising a family becoming wealthy and gaining knowledge. succeed here and you ll be able to buy odd gifts for your sim to improve his or her life like a money tree that pays dividends or a fountain of youth water cooler. what else is new of course you wouldn t be able to juggle all that if it weren t for the improved free will option which makes it easier for sims to fulfill their basic needs. the artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved they won t turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but strangely they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor. another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan. now sims are born with the traits of their parents families grow and sims grow old. not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations growing up is the first aspiration that a baby sim will have it provides a limited time with which your sims can achieve their goals. the universal control panel helps you manage your sim family. a family affair the sims 2 not only lets you create just about any type of sim in any type of family build elaborate houses and even create a neighborhood from scratch but it also allows you to start the game in medias res with premade households. these families all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap opera plots lots of scheming romance ghosts and family fighting. parents of teens shouldn t worry though because nudity is tastefully blurred out and woo hoo between sims takes place completely under the covers. the esrb has given this a teen rating. if the sims 2 were a film it would likely land between pg and pg 13. the makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you ve created. for example you can capture in game stills and video to show friends the private moments family interactions and house parties of your sims. you can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special web site. the sims 2 is for patient gamers. like life itself the game is filled with mundane details like getting ready for work and doing dishes. the game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run and gun game genres wouldn t know what to do with. but those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they ve created themselves. porter b. hall set up a sims 2 machinima studio amazon.com contributor porter hall reveals how you can make movies using the sims as your actors. see his guide to setting up a sims 2 machinima studio. aspyr media 49.99|aspyr the sims 2 system requirements operating system mac os x 10.3.8 or later cpu processor powerpc g4 g5 cpu speed 1.2ghz or faster memory 256 mb or higher hard disk space 3gb free disk space video card ati radeon 9000 or better video card nvidia ... 45.99

the expansion pack features an increase in the level cap to 70. there are two new playable races including the magical blood elves that you can read more about below. the other race has not yet been released by blizzard. there will be new starting zones in quel thalas and beyond. another eye opening addition is the entirely new unexplored continent of outland that is reachable through the dark portal. plus you ll find many new high level dungeons to explore in azeroth outland and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. there are new flying mounts in outland tons of new and dangerous monsters including epic world bosses hundreds of new quests and items and even a new profession jewelcrafting. of course this isn t the end of the list this is just a glimpse of what blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack. the new story the rumors and more several years have passed since the burning legion s defeat at mount hyjal and the races of azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. with renewed strength the heroes of the horde and alliance have begun to explore new lands and have broken through the dark portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. in this expansion pack the burning crusade refers to the burning legion s ongoing efforts to destroy life on azeroth. to date the burning legion s exploits have been documented in warcraft iii and in the war of the ancients novel trilogy. as part of the expansion pack players will now be able to travel through the dark portal to confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon s domain. players will also gain access to quel thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh s tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell s unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they d learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel thalas and reduced the once mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell s energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell s mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves darkest hour came kael thas sunstrider the last of quel thalas royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies even demonic energies in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan s watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner zhul the dark warlord of horde had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway s clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later towards the end of the third war the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner zhul s gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade s storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role playing warcrafters. blizzard entertainment 39.99|world of warcraft burning crusade 39.99

providing an experience that is unmatched by any other software corel painter has grown to become the world s most powerful painting illustration application. artists designers and photographers continue to enjoy many features that have been the cornerstones of this ground breaking application for years. the following features let creative professionals leverage their natural talents and techniques to create original works of art distinguishing corel painter from other applications. brushes brushes have always been the heart and soul of corel painter. there are more than 30 brush categories ranging from crayons chalk and charcoal to acrylics watercolor liquid ink artists oils and the new realbristle. while most brush categories mirror the look and feel of traditional brushes others offer users a one of a kind creative tool. brushes are organized into distinct categories each featuring a multitude of variants. the following brush categories are just a sample of those available to corel painter x customers. artists oils painting system the artists oils painting system enables users to apply paint blends created in the mixer palette directly onto images in the document window. each brush dab loads the brush variant with a finite amount of oil. as the oil runs out the brush stroke becomes fainter. brush strokes interact with any paint already on the canvas just as they would with natural media. watercolor watercolor brush variants produce natural looking watercolor effects. almost all brush variants in the watercolor category interact with the canvas texture. for most of these variants stylus pressure affects the width of the brush stroke. as with traditional media watercolor brushes greater pressure on the brush widens a stroke and less pressure narrows a stroke. chalk chalk brush variants produce the thick rich texture of natural chalk sticks and cover with strokes that interact with the paper grain. the opacity is linked to stylus pressure. image hose the image hose behaves like a brush but it sprays images instead of applying paint. users can also load their own image or select from the library included in the application. cloners painting with a cloner brush is similar to painting with any corel painter brush except that cloner brush variants take their color information from a clone source such as a pattern or another image instead of from the colors palette. some cloner brush variants reproduce a source image directly. other cloner brush variants reproduce a source image with low opacity and soft edges or use paper grain and specialized dabs for particular media effects. brush controls brush control palettes provide quick easy access to all brush settings and controls. making on the fly changes to brush settings and variables is as simple as dragging a slider 128 without any disruption to workflow. for example the boost slider found in the general palette of the brush controls instantly enhances brush speed. just drag the slider and see brush performance accelerate. gitanjali rao s printed rainbow animated film. winner of three best short film awards at cannes 2006 including the kodak discovery award 128 best short film the young critics award 128 best short film and the rail d or 128 best short film. www.printedrainbow.com textures in the traditional art world an artist s brush or drawing tool produces different results when applied to surfaces with different textures. corel painter allows users to control the texture of the canvas to achieve the results they would expect from conventional art media on a given surface. brushes interact with paper grain just as natural tools react with the texture of the surfaces beneath them. textures can also be used to create special effects such as rusted metal on an intergalactic spaceship or bark on a tree. animation corel painter has an impressive array of animation features. the onion skinning feature enables users to view previous and future frames while working on the current frame. the rotoscoping feature enables users to paint and modify a single frame of an existing movie. animated movies can be saved as animated gifs quicktime movies or avi movies. support for industry standard file formats corel painter lets users open and save a variety of file formats including adobe photoshop psd corel paint shop pro psp tiff cmyk rgb

update checking make sure you always have the latest version the industry standard for image enlargement genuine fractals 5 is the industry standard for image resizing. it s renowned across the photographic and printing industries for its ability to increase image size well over 1000 without the loss of sharpness or detail that you would normally expect. its patented fractal based interpolation algorithms work like nothing else and the results speak for themselves. genuine fractals 5 is a must for any photographer who makes large format and poster sized prints. it s also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and make a high quality print from it. genuine fractals 5 can even work its magic with digital video still frames up rezzing from standard definition to high definition video quality. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work such as magazine publications or tradeshow and billboard graphics. why should i use genuine fractals 5 resizing an image larger than the original size requires that new pixels be created. this process is called interpolation or up rezzing. there are many mathematical ways called algorithms to do this. the most common method used by default by many pixel editing applications is called bicubic interpolation. bicubic along with with its newer variants bicubic smoother and bicubic sharper work by averaging a small group of neighboring pixels to determine the color value of the new pixels to be added. while this technique is fast it does not distinguish edges so there is a uniform loss of sharpness and detail across the image. genuine fractals and bicubic smoother comparison genuine fractals 5 patented algorithms work differently. it starts by analyzing ever decreasing sizes of pixel blocks in your image looking for repeating natural patterns at different sizes. these are known as fractals. fractals are common naturally repeating patterns found everywhere. for example a river system viewed from space has the same shape as the veins in a leaf. these are both fractal patterns at very different scales. the great thing about fractal patterns is once you find them they can be scaled to any size without loss in detail. this allows genuine fractals 5 to resize your image over 1000 without losing sharpness and edge detail. unmatched image resizing genuine fractals 5 can resize your images over 1000 and still maintain sharp edges and minute details. to give you an idea of how big that is you could take a full frame image from a six megapixel image and resize it to make a print of 10x15 feet at 180 ppi it is a must for any photographer or artist who makes large format or poster sized prints. it is also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and still make a high quality print from it. cropping can leave you with very few pixels to work with. if you where to crop this professional 12 megapixel image to keep just the antelope you would be left with only four megapixels of information barely enough to make a good 5x7 print. however with genuine fractals 5 you could make a print over 6 feet tall. save hard disk space and bandwidth increasing the size and resolution of a file results in a larger file on disk. you can reduce the disk space needed and bandwidth when transferring files by saving your files into the genuine fractals 5 .stn format which provides lossless and visually lossless wavelet compression to cut your file size in half or more. now you can store twice as many images on your hard drive and upload them in half the time. long time users of genuine fractals remember having to save files as a .stn file before being able to scale the image. in genuine fractals 5 any file that is opened in photoshop can be scaled in one easy step without having to save as a .stn file first. batch processing with genuine fractals 5 genuine fractals 5 can be automated easily by using a photoshop action. by default genuine fractals 5 remembers its last used setting however you can create a photoshop action to resize an entire folder of images at the same time. not just for photographers genuine fractals 5 is not just for photographers but anyone who needs to resize images. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work. genuine fractals 5 can also help you create tradeshow and

images with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they re just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash swf export for vector based animations . studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame by frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone rigging feature also uses spring like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro s switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show the position of objects in your scene at a given point in time just click on any point in the timeline to see the onion skins in anime studio pro. in anime studio pro you can use actions little clips of animation that are associated with a layer or group of layers to create reusable animations for movements that you expect to use repeatedly. tweening adjusts the pace of movements within a given action so you can slow it down or speed it up. and pro s graph mode allows you to inspect an animation curve plotted as values on a graph. this helps evaluate acceleration changes in direction and other properties of motion. anime studio pro includes over 200 sample files and is filled with content that includes the standard anime studio content files such as anime characters aya and winsor backgrounds animation other characters scenery and props. anime studio pro also includes extra samples such as 3d animals 3d movies and samples provided by users that serve as great starting points. efrontier 199.99|allume anime studio pro mac os x v10.3.9+

0|cisco security server agent for windows and solaris license 100 agents win solaris csa b100 srvr k9 the next generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host based agents that are deployed on mission critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer ssl protocols 128 bit ssl for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. cisco systems enterprise 0|individual software professor teaches excel word professor teaches excel and word is the complete multimedia training program for the most popular microsoft applications. it covers versions for office 2003 and office xp. both core and advanced courses are included. eight separate tutorials on two ... 19.99
