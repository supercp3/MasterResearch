instead the game allows you to customize your character's proficiencies and make dramatic changes to your skill set on the fly. also each character's set of statistics such as perception and belief predispose them toward one style of play or another. gameplay is primarily turn-based combat that occurs during randomly generated missions in search of targets or objects. you earn currency experience points and loot (such as weapons and other items) from accomplishing missions and defeating opponents. many missions have multiple stages and while it's possible to finish them on your own it's much more efficient to plow through them with a group of other players. the matrix online allows players to form groups of up to a dozen called crews that are more permanent in nature and multiple crews can come together to form a faction. in addition to fighting foes using hand-to-hand combat guns and viruses characters can create useful items by compiling them. one of the most enticing aspects of the matrix online is the promise of an evolving storyline that develops based on each players' actions ensuring that you will keep coming back not just for the thrill of the game but in order to see how the story turns out. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath. view larger. everquest: evolution and everquest ii as the game that originally helped create the market for the massive multiplayer online role-playing genre the everquest line of role-playing games require little explanation. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath but in everquest ii norrath has been stricken by a cataclysmic event that caused civilization to virtually collapse leaving only two main metropolises intact. in both evolution and everquest ii you must choose your character's race profession and alignment before you head out in to the world to gain experience win renown and hopefully become rich and powerful beyond your wildest dreams. everquest: evolution features the original game plus all of the expansion packs released so far including the ruins of kunark the scars of velious the shadows of luclin the planes of power and the legacy of ykesha. everquest ii includes the new world order a ton of original content breathtaking new graphics and several tweaks to gameplay such as a purely player-versus-environment gameplay design that removes the original everquest's option of attacking other players. as one of the most participated in and deeply developed massively-multiplayer online games ever created both everquest: evolution and everquest ii will provide you with virtually endless entertainment and challenges. sony creative software 29.99,sony pc video game - the station access collection - dvd-rom super fast shipping - platinum reseller ratings - over 12 years in business  4.99

423,0,microsoft windows xp professional full version with sp2 with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security. microsoft 299.99,the sims expansion collection vol 1   8.72

windows media or quicktime. the file is then sent to the reviewer who plays it back with adobe acrobat or adobe reader software. whenever the reviewer pauses the video the current timecode is automatically entered into the comment box. remarks can be entered at the exact point at which the video is paused. when the file containing these remarks is sent back and imported into the sequence the comments appear as clip markers at the appropriate timecode locations in the timeline. adobe clip notes facilitates collaboration expedites the review and approval process and takes the pain out of keeping everyone in the loop. adobe 849,freeverse software 006 active lancer join lancer squad an elite team of flight capable soldiers on their current mission to defeat the diabolical war machine

528,0,cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ) the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. cisco systems - enterprise 0,student dictionary expand your vocabulary while you increase your comprehension with snap! student dictionary. with its expansive database and effective use of graphics it is high-definition reference software for home and school!  8.95

599,0,cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ) the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. cisco systems - enterprise 0,student dictionary expand your vocabulary while you increase your comprehension with snap! student dictionary. with its expansive database and effective use of graphics it is high-definition reference software for home and school!  8.95

resizing an image larger than the original size requires that new pixels be created. this process is called interpolation or up-rezzing. there are many mathematical ways called algorithms to do this. the most common method used by default by many pixel editing applications is called bicubic interpolation. bicubic along with with its newer variants bicubic smoother and bicubic sharper work by averaging a small group of neighboring pixels to determine the color value of the new pixels to be added. while this technique is fast it does not distinguish edges so there is a uniform loss of sharpness and detail across the image. genuine fractals and bicubic smoother comparison genuine fractals 5 patented algorithms work differently. it starts by analyzing ever-decreasing sizes of pixel blocks in your image looking for repeating natural patterns at different sizes. these are known as fractals. fractals are common naturally repeating patterns found everywhere. for example a river system viewed from space has the same shape as the veins in a leaf. these are both fractal patterns at very different scales. the great thing about fractal patterns is once you find them they can be scaled to any size without loss in detail. this allows genuine fractals 5 to resize your image over 1000% without losing sharpness and edge detail. unmatched image resizing genuine fractals 5 can resize your images over 1000% and still maintain sharp edges and minute details. to give you an idea of how big that is you could take a full-frame image from a six megapixel image and resize it to make a print of 10x15 feet at 180 ppi! it is a must for any photographer or artist who makes large format or poster sized prints. it is also great for journalists sports and wildlife photographers who may need to take a cropped section of an image and still make a high-quality print from it. cropping can leave you with very few pixels to work with. if you where to crop this professional 12 megapixel image to keep just the antelope you would be left with only four megapixels of information barely enough to make a good 5x7 print. however with genuine fractals 5 you could make a print over 6 feet tall. save hard disk space and bandwidth increasing the size and resolution of a file results in a larger file on disk. you can reduce the disk space needed and bandwidth when transferring files by saving your files into the genuine fractals 5 .stn format which provides lossless and visually lossless wavelet compression to cut your file size in half or more. now you can store twice as many images on your hard drive and upload them in half the time. long time users of genuine fractals remember having to save files as a .stn file before being able to scale the image. in genuine fractals 5 any file that is opened in photoshop can be scaled in one easy step without having to save as a .stn file first. batch processing with genuine fractals 5 genuine fractals 5 can be automated easily by using a photoshop action. by default genuine fractals 5 remembers its last used setting--however you can create a photoshop action to resize an entire folder of images at the same time. not just for photographers genuine fractals 5 is not just for photographers but anyone who needs to resize images. graphic designers can end the everyday problem of receiving low resolution images from clients for high resolution print work. genuine fractals 5 can also help you create tradeshow and billboard graphics from average sized images. genuine fractals 5 is also commonly used by service bureaus as well as law enforcement and architects for resizing small files. onone software 159.95,onone software inc. gfs-50211 - genuine fractals 5 full 1u onone software inc. gfs-50211 : enlarge your images over 1000% with no loss in image quality. genuine fractals 5 simply produces higher quality and sharper results than traditional scaling methods in photoshop or in any other third party product. ol ...  148.97

for manipulating objects. the new integrated image adjustment lab saves designers valuable time and is accessible from both corel photo-paint and coreldraw. design professionals often work with files that have poor color balance and contrast and they need to use multiple tools to make adjustments. the image adjustment lab addresses this problem by uniting a number of manual and automatic controls for common color and tone corrections providing an intuitive and fast way to achieve professional image adjustments. the image adjustment lab also lets users create snapshots of their adjustments with just one click. the snapshots appear below the working preview which lets users easily compare each snapshot against the original and choose the best result. built on the power of corel knockout the

717,1,microsoft windows xp professional upgrade with sp2 with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp home edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security. microsoft software 199.99,microsoft windows xp professional edition (upgrade) key features: more

738,1,microsoft windows xp professional full version with sp2 with windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 you get safer browsing and communication powerful security tools and improved experiences. windows xp is the operating system release that unifies the microsoft range with all the desktop versions now built on the nt/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of windows 95 98 and me. that makes xp a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and me line but for those already on windows 2000 professional it is a closer call. despite the similar name there is no special synergy between windows xp and office xp which works fine on windows 2000. the security center lets you check the status of your essential security settings. xp certainly looks different with rounded window corners larger and more detailed icons and a clean-look desktop that on first installation shows only the taskbar and recycle bin. xp is also more customizable than earlier versions of windows and includes visual themes that let you change the whole appearance of windows in an instant. that is the window-dressing but underneath are some significant improvements. one of the most interesting is remote desktop. a standard xp feature this uses technology from microsoft terminal server to enable users to access their computer over any connection; for example by dialing into the office from home. this is not just file access--this technology lets you run applications remotely as if you were sitting at your desk at work. this is mature technology stable and carefully thought out. so for example you can print from a remote word processor to a local printer. a variation on the theme is remote assistance where the user can allow a remote helper to view their desktop or optionally gain control of the keyboard and mouse in order to troubleshoot a problem. the feature can also be disabled to ease security concerns. laptop users benefit from enhanced power management with options to extend battery life by reducing cpu speed and display brightness. irda support has been fixed so that unlike windows 2000 windows xp can easily use modems in mobile telephones via infrared. a new screen font cleartype improves legibility for laptop or other flat screens and there is built-in support for wireless networking using the popular 802.11 standard. a great feature of xp also found in windows 2000 is the ability to synchronize network files with offline copies. previously these files could not be stored securely but now they can be encrypted. the information bar in windows xp professional edition with service pack 2 notifies you when it blocks activex control or active content and then lets you decide what to do. for web browsing xp comes with internet explorer 6.0. the enhancements in ie 6.0 are mainly of interest to web developers and in any case microsoft makes ie freely available to all windows users. although java is not installed by default it is not difficult to download a java virtual machine (jvm). windows messenger originally a chat client has evolved into a collaboration tool that allows for video conferencing and application sharing. service pack 2 allows users to instruct internet explorer how to handle downloads from a specific publisher the most significant new feature for internet users is the built-in firewall. a firewall protects against one of the most disturbing security risks in which other users unknown to you might connect to your computer while it is online reading private files or causing other damage. xp's built-in firewall is a simple affair but it does prevent most types of unauthorized connection. windows xp has strong multimedia features. the new media player lets you copy music from cd to hard disk create your own playlist and write your own music cds if you have a cd writer. although there is loss of quality as a result of compression the process is easy and convenient. media player 8.0 can play back dvd video but only if a hardware or software dvd decoder is already installed. you can also play mp3 audio files and mpeg videos but sadly not the popular realmedia formats. in the end media player does nothing that you cannot also do with free alternatives but it is slick and nicely integrated. the xp user interface is not a radical departure from earlier versions of windows but there are a number of small changes that together add up to a significant improvement. the start menu now automatically features the most frequently used programs at the top of the list and you can add and remove shortcuts by right-clicking the icon and selecting pin or unpin from the pop-up menu. windows online help is integrated into a help and support center that works like an internal web site with searchable help tutorials and walk-throughs. windows xp professional includes all the features of windows xp home and adds support for dual processors encryptable file systems offline folders the remote desktop as described above and extra administration features that come into play when connected to a windows server domain. xp is demanding on hardware and it would be a mistake to install it on less than microsoft's recommended minimum requirements. there is also activation to consider a mildly annoying anti-piracy measure that requires you to obtain a code from microsoft for full installation and in the future if you reinstall or make major system changes. windows xp service pack 2 features internet explorer pop-up blocker makes browsing the internet more enjoyable by enabling you to reduce unwanted ads and content. internet explorer download monitoring warns you about potentially harmful downloads and gives you the option to block files that could be malicious. internet explorer information bar provides better information about events that are happening as you browse the web so it& 8217;s easier to know what& 8217;s going on and address potential security issues. windows security center allows you to easily view your security status and manage key security settings in one convenient place. windows firewall update automatically turned on by default this improved firewall helps protect windows xp from viruses worms and other security threats that can spread over the internet. improved wireless support dramatically improves and simplifies the process of discovering and connecting to wireless networks. bluetooth technologies enables you to easily connect to the latest bluetooth-enabled hardware devices such as keyboards cell phones and pdas. windows media player 9 series makes it easy to enjoy music video and broadband content with enhanced security. microsoft 299.99,microsoft windows xp pro sp2 retail   299.99

869,1,cisco security server agent for windows and solaris - license - 100 agents - win solaris ( csa-b100-srvr-k9 ) the next-generation cisco security agent network security software provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems also known as endpoints. the cisco security agent goes beyond conventional endpoint security solutions by identifying and preventing malicious behavior before it can occur thereby removing potential known and unknown security risks that threaten enterprise networks and applications. because the cisco security agent analyzes behavior rather than relying on signature matching its solution provides robust protection with reduced operational costs. as recent high-visibility attacks like code red and the sql slammer worm have shown traditional technologies are limited in their abilities to combat the effects of new and evolving attacks. customers require host security that protects throughout all stages of an attack and provides important protection against new and unknown threats. assaults on network systems typically go through stages. cisco recognizes that only a layered approach is effective against security breaches that can occur at any stage from beyond the perimeter to the server or at the file level. the cisco security agent proactively defends against damage to a host throughout all stages of the attack whereas other technologies provide early-stage protection and only then when a signature is known. the cisco security agent is specifically designed to protect against new attacks where there is no known signature. the cisco security agent consists of a management console resident on a server and host-based agents that are deployed on mission-critical desktops and servers. the agents use the http and secure sockets layer (ssl) protocols (128-bit ssl) for the management interface and for the communications between agents and the management console. cisco systems - enterprise 0,cisco security server agent (windows and solaris) 100-agent bundle with the addition of cisco security agent endpoint security software cisco offers its customers the most comprehensive network security threat protection portfolio for securing large corporate networks.  64821.43

945,0,world of warcraft expansion: burning crusade blizzard entertainment took online role playing by storm with their hit title world of warcraft. with mind-boggling improvements in graphics gameplay networking and interface -- really every category -- this game became the crown prince of the genre. world of warcraft players will be excited by the approaching release of the new expansion pack: world of warcraft: the burning crusade. this pack expands the already massive award-winning multiplayer online role-playing game by tremendous bounds adding new races lands battlegrounds professions and items and much much more. although no release date has been set here is sample of what you can expect from the burning crusade. the burning crusade is the highly anticipated unreleased expansion pack for blizzard's world of warcraft. what lies in medivh's tower? view larger. blood elves emerge as a new race in the burning crusade. view larger. the blood elves seek the golden destiny that has been promised to them. view larger. warcraft's newest continent: outland. view larger. once a beautiful land outland has been ravaged by war. view larger. outland is a vital strategic location. view larger. the expansion pack features an increase in the level cap to 70. there are two new playable races including the magical blood elves that you can read more about below. the other race has not yet been released by blizzard. there will be new starting zones in quel'thalas and beyond. another eye-opening addition is the entirely new unexplored continent of outland that is reachable through the dark portal. plus you'll find many new high-level dungeons to explore in azeroth outland and elsewhere that will substantially boost gameplay. there are new flying mounts in outland; tons of new and dangerous monsters (including epic world bosses); hundreds of new quests and items; and even a new profession: jewelcrafting. of course this isn't the end of the list -- this is just a glimpse of what blizzard has planned for their unreleased expansion pack. the new story the rumors and more several years have passed since the burning legion's defeat at mount hyjal and the races of azeroth have continued to rebuild their once shattered lives. with renewed strength the heroes of the horde and alliance have begun to explore new lands and have broken through the dark portal to investigate the realms beyond the known world. in this expansion pack the burning crusade refers to the burning legion's ongoing efforts to destroy life on azeroth. to date the burning legion's exploits have been documented in warcraft iii and in the war of the ancients novel trilogy. as part of the expansion pack players will now be able to travel through the dark portal to confront the legion on otherworldly battlefields. although only one race has been revealed blizzard has announced plans to unveil details about possible additional races at a later date. on the other hand many details have been released about the new continent outland. players last visited outland in warcraft iii: the frozen throne alongside illidan as he conquered the pit lord magtheridon's domain. players will also gain access to quel'thalas the region to the northeast of the forsaken lands where the blood elves reside. blizzard says that this expansion pack holds even more new areas that are ripe for player exploration -- additional details will be revealed in the months ahead. blizzard also has plans to add new dungeons and battlegrounds with the expansion though the exact number has not yet been determined. one upcoming dungeon that has players excited is karazhan which is located within medivh's tower. because medivh has played such a central role in warcraft lore blizzard is convinced that longtime players will be especially interested in seeing what karazhan contains. as for battlegrounds blizzard has released very little information. however they have announced plans to make some of the battles from the past accessible through the caverns of time. blood elves: the new race thousands of years ago the exiled highborne landed on the shores of lordaeron and founded the enchanted kingdom of quel'thas. these high elves as they called themselves created a fountain of vast magical energies within the heart of their land -- the sunwell. over time they grew dependant on the sunwell's unstable energies regardless of the bitter lessons they'd learned in ages past. during the third war the villainous prince arthas invaded quel'thalas and reduced the once-mighty realm to rubble and ashes. his undead army decimated nearly all of the high elven population. in addition he used the sunwell's energies to resurrect a powerful undead lich kel'thuzad thereby fouling the sunwell's mystical waters. the few elven survivors realizing that they had been cut off from the source of their arcane power grew increasingly volatile and desperate. in the midst of the elves' darkest hour came kael'thas sunstrider the last of quel'thalas' royal bloodline. kael as he was commonly known knew that the remnant of his people would not long survive without the nourishing magic that once empowered them. renaming his people blood elves in honor of their fallen countrymen kael taught the survivors how to tap into ambient mystical energies -- even demonic energies -- in order to sate their terrible thirst for magic. in search of a new destiny for his people kael'thas ventured to the remote world of outland where he encountered the fallen night elf illidan. under illidan's watchful eye kael and his blood elves regained much of their former power. unfortunately the blood elves practice of embracing demonic energies caused their former comrades in the alliance to shun them. thus the remaining blood elves on azeroth look desperately to the horde to help them reach outland where they can reunite with kael'thas and achieve the golden destiny he has promised them. outland: the new continent once the beautiful homeworld of the orcs all that remains of draenor is the scattered wastes of outland. following the second war the alliance invaded draenor by crossing through the dark portal. to their horror they discovered that ner'zhul -- the dark warlord of horde -- had constructed a series of new gateways that could lead the beaten horde to newer unspoiled worlds. as the alliance forces closed in around him ner'zhul opened his gateways as a means of escape. however his plan backfired and the gateway's clashing energies resulted in a massive catastrophic explosion that ultimately ripped the world of draenor to pieces. nearly thirteen years later -- towards the end of the third war -- the fallen night elf illidan discovered that huge chunks of draenor still existed floating upon the astral winds of the twisting nether. after his defeat at the hands of the evil prince arthas illidan fled to the remnants of draenor and dubbed them outland. he quickly seized control of the chaotic region and sealed the last of ner'zhul's gateways. though he is the undisputed ruler of the ravaged land illidan lives in fear that he will be discovered by his powerful enemies -- most notably arthas the new lich king and the remaining lords of the burning legion. for now outland is home to a number of scattered draenei tribes primitive orcs and powerful arcane creatures of the nether itself. agents of the burning legion have also targeted the region as a vital strategic location in their unending burning crusade to scour all life from the universe. what else can expected? blizzard has tantalized warcraft players with the brief glimpse into the burning crusade's storyline. will these heroes find friends or foes? what dangers and rewards lie in wait beyond the dark portal? and what will they do when they discover that the demons they thought were vanquished have returned to renew their terrible burning crusade? these and other questions will remain unanswered until the gameplay can be explored by role-playing warcrafters. blizzard entertainment 39.99,hewlett packard 302127-b21 prol essentials rdp v1.x 1u flex lic min qty 5 prol essentials rdp v1.x 1u flex lic min qty 5
